    <div id="explaination">
      <p>If you are in the same position as I am, you may be interested
         in buying a house at this time in your life. There are many questions that come up when deciding
         to buy a house such as style, location, and preferences; but the most
         important is finance. How much are you supposed to spend on a house?
         Most lenders reccommend a monthly mortgage payment of 28% of your gross
         monthly income for a conventional loan. Lenders also require at least 20%
         of the home value as a downpayment in a conventional loan purchase. There are many other factors that
         may affect your ability to qualify for a conventional loan such as debt and reliability of income
         but for simplicity sake, ignore those other factors at this time and assume
         you have no other significant debt. To calculate
         how much house you can afford, you will need to know your annual gross income,
         your approximate interest rate for a loan, and the loan length.

    <div id="conclusion">
      <p> This method is only a starting point and will only give you an idea of
          how much of a house you can afford. There are many other factors that
          can changes how much you can afford such as other assets, liabilities,
          and your financial comfort level. I would highly suggest that you talk
          to a qualified financial consultant or a real estate agent.
